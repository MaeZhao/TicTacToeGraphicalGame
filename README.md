## Reminders in uploading to GitHub:
  - Upload your _personal versions_ of code as a **NEW  BRANCH** (not as MASTER)
  - Code checked and agreed upon by every body in the _group_ is uploaded to **MASTER BRANCH**!
## THINGS LEFT TO DO:
  - GET RID OF UNECESSARY VARIABLES
  - FIX THE TURN SKIPPING WHEN A FILLED CELL IS PICKED
  - MAKE SURE YOU CAN WIN ON THE 9TH TURN (IF COUNTER >=9)
